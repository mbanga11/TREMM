TREMM is a Discord bot built for CSS 360 to help groups plan trips without leaving the chat. It provides travel-friendly tools like checking destination weather, starting a shared trip plan, browsing activities, and quickly comparing flight and hotel options.

## Commands Included in v1.0

### ✅ `/weather <destination>`
**User story:** As a Discord server member, I want the bot to show the current weather and forecast for a location so I can decide whether it’s a good time to travel there.

**What it does:**
- Returns current conditions (temperature, feels-like, humidity, wind)
- Returns a short-term forecast summary (shown as the next 7 days)

**Notes:**
- Forecasts are limited by the weather data provider (short-term forecast window).

- Starts a trip plan for a destination and trip length
- Creates a shared starting point for the group to build on in Discord

### ✅ `/trip activities <destination>`
**User story:** As a Discord server member, I want the bot to suggest popular activities at a destination so that I don’t have to research attractions myself.

**What it does:**

- Reduces the need for external searching during early planning

### ✅ `/flight <origin> <destination> <departureDate>`
**User story:** As a traveler, I want to receive flight options for my given trip so that I can compare prices, airlines, and schedules before choosing a flight.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- The system retrieves flight options based on provided trip details
- **Input:** `origin`, `destination`, `departureDate`
- **Output:** returns up to 5 flight options
- **Each option shows:** airline, price, depart time, arrive time, stops
- **If API has no results:** bot returns a clear fallback response (ex: “No flights found for those details. Try different dates or airports.”)

### ✅ `/hotel <city> <check_in_date> <check_out_date> <adults>`
**User story:** As a Trip Planner on Discord, I want to use the `/hotel` command to check availability and pricing for a specific city and date range so that I can quickly find options that fit our group's budget without leaving the chat.

**Acceptance Criteria**
- **Input:** accepts `destination (City)`, `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`, and `adults`
- **API:** successfully authenticates and queries the Amadeus Hotel Search API
- **Validation:** bot returns an error message if:
  - check-out date is before check-in date, **or**
  - the city cannot be found
- **Output:** displays a Discord Embed containing the **Top 3** available hotels
- **Data Points:** each hotel includes:
  - Name
  - Star Rating
  - Total Price
- **Links:** includes a clickable link for each hotel to view details externally

### ✅ `/restaurants <city>`
