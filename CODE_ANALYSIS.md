**Tanisha Thakare ~ Bot Project Task #5: Examine Code for Technical Debt and Code Smells**

Examined Code for Technical Debt and Code Smells in the following files:
  - flights.js
  - hotels.js
  - plantrip.js
  - trip.js
  - weather.js
  - Their corresponding helper files

**Technical Debt:** The flaws that make code prone to problems when you want to make changes to the system (e.g. inconsistencies in formatting).


**Code Smells:** Code structure that can cause potential problems with design and maintenance (e.g. duplicated code, long methods, etc.).

**Efforts:**
  - I went through all lines of code for each of the command files that control the slash commands in the discord bot as well as their helper files.
  - Utilizing Command F to easily look for specific elements in the code.
  - Writing up the technical debts, code smells, and potential solutions to those issues.

**Code Smells:**	
1. The first code smell I immediately noticed in the files were the use of emojis. Emojis are a great way to make messages from the discord bot engaging to the user, but it is considered a code smell in the long run. Emojis are Unicode characters, which means that different systems, apps, and machines (Linux vs Windows) can replace them with bitmaps. This is problematic because it can result in different display views, making the code more complicated than it needs to be. Although, it is okay to use emojis in messages sent to the user, like in Discord.

2. The next code risk I found was the use of repeated code in multiple files. For example, our bot takes in dates for the trip among different categories, such as flights, hotels, weather, etc. The formatting in which the date is handled is different in flights.js (YYYY-MM-DD), plantrip.js (MM-DD-YYYY), and hotels.js (YYYY-MM-DD). Another example of this repeating code logic is in converting data to user readable output. The file weather.js uses pct01ToPct() method to convert decimals to percentages for rain chance, while flight.js uses formatStops() method to show 0 layovers for a direct flight and 1 layover to show one stop layover. Since the implementations are similar for these files, repeating the same logic in multiple places make it hard to keep track of. A way to solve this problem is to have a specific file just for tracking the formatting and other things for repeated code. This way, everything is all in one place so if you do need to change something, you can just change it in the one file.

3. The last code smell I’ll talk about is having multiple actions happen in one, long method. For example, in the weather.js file, there is a method called execute(interaction), which gets the weather data for a 7-day forecast at a location, gets weekly mins, maxes, and peak rain percentages, does the formatting for all that, and then sends the whole message into the Discord channel. Having all these steps crammed into one method can make it easily prone to errors and is hard to keep track of. A way to solve this problem is to have each functionality part in a different method, then just call those methods into the execute(interaction) method. This way, it is easier to understand and test without any problems.

**Technical Debt:**
1. The first technical debt I have observed in the main files is how errors are being handled in the files. For example, the helper files for flights.js, hotels.js, and weather.js errors are handled with the return ({ok: false, message) command. But, in the weather.js command file, the execute method puts all this information into a try/catch block, allowing for multiple types of errors to be taken into consideration. This difference in error handling makes a huge difference in the problems that can arise, making it difficult to maintain it. A solution to this problem is to coordinate error handling so that all of the helper files handle errors in the same format, helping with consistency and easy readability.

2. The next technical debt I have observed in the files is that there is inconsistent price formatting for the flights.js file and the hotels.js file. For example, flight prices are displayed as “$123.45” and hotel prices are displayed as “1234.56 USD.” This is important because we eventually want to implement a summary command, where it shows the summary of trip (which will show the total cost of the planned trip). This inconsistency makes it difficult to total costs up or have other functions with the cost variable. The solution that would make sense for this problem is to include a method in the files where it formats the costs a specific way in all files the same way.

3. The last technical debt I’ll talk about is how the helper file weather.js includes a network helper section, while the helper files hotels.js and flights.js do not have retry logic. This means that if the API has a network problem or fails, the weather.js file reloads it while hotel.js and flights.js will fail and return an error after the first try. This is important to consider because it would be a usability flaw if it just failed immediately. The best solution for this would be to implement a similar network help section, just like the weather.js helper file.


## **Manraj Banga: Unit testing 3 diffrent files with 8 tests**  
   
A total of **8 unit tests** were added covering validation and error-handling logic.

### Files Tested

### 1. src/helpers/hotels.js

**Function tested:** getHotelOptions()

#### Tests Added:
- Check-out date before check-in → returns error
- Check-out date equals check-in → returns error
- Invalid date strings → returns error

#### Findings:
- Invalid date strings fail indirectly rather than through explicit validation.
- There is no validation for:
  - adults <= 0

### 2. src/helpers/flights.js

**Function tested:** getFlightOptions()

#### Tests Added:
- Missing Amadeus credentials → returns clear error
- Missing required fields → returns clear error
- Missing only departureDate → returns error

#### Findings:
- Early-return validation is implemented for missing fields.
- Credentials are validated only when the function is called.
- No validation exists for:
  - adults <= 0
  - invalid date format
  - invalid IATA airport code format

### 3. src/helpers/geocode.js

**Function tested:** geocodePlace()

Tests were implemented using a mocked fetch call.

#### Tests Added:
- API returns empty array → function returns null
- API returns valid lat/lon → numeric conversion works correctly

#### Findings:
- Proper handling of empty API results.
- Lat/lon values are converted using Number(), but:
  - There is no validation for malformed numeric values.

#### Weakness Identified:
If the external API returned malformed coordinates, the function would return `NaN` values without validation.


### Basic Comments 
Core helpers depend heavily on live API responses.

Implications:
- Harder to test success paths without mocking
- Greater risk of runtime failures due to API changes or rate limits

**Some Recommendation:**
use Separation for:
- Input validation
- Data transformation
- External API calls

This would improve testability and maintainability.



## Raya Parsa — Threat Modeling (Bot Project Task #5)

### Overview
This threat model analyzes potential security risks in the TREMM Discord Trip Bot, focusing on user input handling, API calls, environment variables, and message output.

### Assets to Protect
- API keys stored in environment variables
- User-provided trip data
- Discord bot token
- External API responses

### Entry Points
- Slash command inputs (origin, destination, date, adults)
- Discord user messages
- External API responses (flights, hotels, weather)

  ### Trust Boundaries
- Discord user input → Bot command handler
- Command handler → Helper functions
- Helper functions → External APIs (Flights, Hotels, Weather)
- Bot → Discord response output

These boundaries represent transitions between trusted and untrusted data sources.

### Threats Identified

1. Input Validation Bypass  
Users could input malformed airport codes or invalid dates to break logic or cause unexpected API errors.

Mitigation:
- Strict validation of IATA codes
- Date format enforcement
- Reject past dates

2. API Failure / Network Dependency  
If external APIs fail, the bot may crash or expose error details.

Mitigation:
- Consistent error handling pattern (`{ ok: false, message }`)
- Retry logic similar to weather helper
- Graceful fallback responses

3. Sensitive Data Exposure  
If environment variables or API keys are logged or committed accidentally, credentials could be leaked.

Mitigation:
- Use `.env` files
- Ensure `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- Never log tokens or secrets

4. Denial of Service (Spam Commands)  
Users could repeatedly spam slash commands causing excessive API calls.

Mitigation:
- Implement rate limiting
- Add cooldown per user
- Cache repeated results temporarily

  ### Abuse Cases
- A user submits a 5000-character string as an airport code to attempt buffer stress.
- A user repeatedly spams `/hotels` to overload API calls.
- A user enters malformed dates (e.g., 13-45-9999) to trigger unexpected errors.

### Risk Severity Assessment

| Threat | Likelihood | Impact | Severity |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|
| Invalid input | High | Medium | Medium |
| API failure | Medium | Medium | Medium |
| Credential leak | Low | High | High |
| Spam abuse | Medium | Medium | Medium |

### Conclusion
The bot currently handles input validation partially but could improve consistency in error handling, retry logic, and rate limiting. Addressing these areas would reduce technical risk and improve reliability.


## 4. Marco Chan: Automated Fuzz Testing
**Scope:** `/hotels` (Trip Planning Module) & General Command Handler
**Effort:** Implemented two fuzzing suites to test stability against malformed inputs.

**Files Created:**
* `src/fuzz/fuzz-hotel.js` (Targeted Fuzzer)
* `src/fuzz/fuzz-bot.js` (General Command Fuzzer)

**Methodology:**
1.  **Targeted Fuzzing:** Created a script designed to stress-test the core trip-planning logic (`getHotelOptions`). It bypassed the Discord UI to inject raw garbage data directly into the function, including SQL injection strings, buffer overflows (2000+ chars), invalid dates, and null/undefined values.
2.  **General Bot Fuzzing:** Developed a dynamic analysis tool that loads all command files and simulates Discord interactions with invalid data types to identify unhandled exceptions across the entire codebase.

**Findings:**
* **Critical Crash (Hotels):** The hotel search logic failed **2 out of 10** stress tests. Passing `null` or `undefined` (simulating a missing API response) caused the bot to crash immediately with a `TypeError`. This is a high-severity issue as it takes the bot offline.
* **General Command Fragility:** The general fuzzer revealed that the `/meme` command crashes on almost any invalid input (8/8 tests failed), throwing "Received one or more errors."
* **Resilience:** The hotel logic successfully handled 8 other attack vectors, including SQL injection attempts and massive string payloads, without crashing.

**Remediation:**
* **Guard Clauses:** Implement "guard clauses" in helper functions to validate that objects exist before attempting to read properties from them.
* **Try/Catch Blocks:** The `/meme` command and other auxiliary commands need to be wrapped in try/catch blocks to ensure that input parsing errors result in a user-friendly error message rather than a bot crash.


## **Kamsochi Ekwueme ~ Assess Cyclomatic Complexity**

**Assessed cyclomatic complexity in the following files:**
  - src/commands/weather.js
  - src/helpers/flights.js
  - src/helpers/hotels.js
  - src/helpers/weather.js

**Cyclomatic Complexity:** 

A metric that estimates how many independent execution paths a function has (more if/else, switch, early returns = higher complexity). Higher complexity generally means harder testing + higher bug risk.

**Efforts:**
  - Used ESLint’s complexity rule to measure complexity across the src/ directory.
  - Scoped analysis to src/**/* to avoid parsing build artifacts.
  - Saved the output for documentation.

**Command Used:**

npx eslint "src/**/*.{js,mjs,cjs}" --parser-options ecmaVersion:latest,sourceType:module --rule "complexity:[2,10]" -f stylish > complexity_output.txt 2>&1 && cat complexity_output.txt

**Findings (functions over the max complexity of 10):**

1) `src/commands/weather.js`
   - `execute()` → complexity **14**

2) `src/helpers/flights.js`
   - `getFlightOptions()` → complexity **12**

3) `src/helpers/hotels.js`
   - `getHotelOptions()` → complexity **12**

4) `src/helpers/weather.js`
   - `weatherCodeToDesc()` → complexity **30**
   - `geocodePlace()` → complexity **21**
   - `getWeather()` → complexity **11**


**Interpretation:**
The functions above have many decision paths, which increases the number of test cases needed to cover edge cases and makes the code harder to modify safely. The largest complexity risks are in the weather helper (weatherCodeToDesc and geocodePlace) due to heavy branching.

**Recommendations:**
  - Split large functions into smaller helper methods (validation, transformation, formatting, API calls).
  - Replace long chains of conditionals with lookup tables/maps where possible (especially weatherCodeToDesc).
  - Prioritize additional unit tests for the high-complexity functions to cover more branches.
